# Last Stop Shop

A mysterious store that lies at the end of the universe, nobody knows how to get there. But some unlucky souls end up there intentionally. Upon arriving at the store, you are greeted by a mysterious vendor, with even more mysterious products.

This is the premise of the game I made for this challenge, and I had a lot of fun doing it!

### The Code

To facilitate the organization of the scripts and assets I created, I separated them all within the folder /Assets/LastStopShop. All the scripts used were made during the development of this game. I used pre-made assets for building the tilemap, UI, player design, and player animations. I used Scriptable Objects to create the store's clothes; besides having information like the name of the clothing or the price, I also added all the images related to the clothing to be shown and equipped.

Among the created scripts, the most important ones are:

Player (controls movement, currently equipped clothing, and coin count)
Inventory (controls the player's equipment, changes which items are equipped)
Shop (buying and selling of products)

### Thought Process

After reading the challenge, I started searching for inspiration for what theme my game would have. After looking through images and texts, I decided to make the game about a store at the end of the universe.

After that, I broke down what I needed to do to create the game into smaller tasks.

My "To Do" list looked like this:

Create scenarios
Create UI
Shop features
Equip clothes
Interactions with the world and sounds
Transitions between scenes

I tested each feature as I developed them and did a general test at the end after creating the build.

### My Performance

I am quite satisfied with the final result. I managed to do everything within the deadline and with good code. However, there is always room for improvement. If I were to continue working on this project, I would add:

A combat system
A player progression system
A story and interactions with the mysterious vendor
More animations in the scenes
It would probably be a roguelike game.

### Playing the Game

You play the game with a combination of mouse (UI interactions) and keyboard (in-game interactions).
WASD to move
E to interact

In-game interactions include:
The sign outside the store
The entrance and exit doors
The vendor
The coin purse on the table to the left of the room. Adds 10 coins to the total.

Thank you for your time! 
I am looking forward to your feedback!

William.
